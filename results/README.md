# Explanation of collected data #

**combined-charts.pdf** contains an overview over the mean-n-effectiveness and cumulative approximation set charts for all use cases and evolutionary algorithms.
**definitions.tex** just contains layout data needed for compiling the charts.
**SIC-mean-compare.ods** and **UC-mean-compare.ods** are manually created summaries for easier comparison of effect sizes, significance and effective differences in mean HV between all configurations.
Data for each use case and evolutionary algorithm can be found in respective sub-folders. These contain the following.

## Archive files ##
The 7z archives contain the raw output data of MDEOptimiser. Despite their small size the extracted data needs up to several gigabytes for each use case.
For each evolutionary computation (called **batch**) a file **batch-\<batchNumber\>-data-steps.csv** is provided containing data about the elapsed time, the population and the approximation set of each iteration of the batch.
A file **batch-\<batchNumber\>-outcome.txt** contains a summary including more inforation about the approximation set of the last iteration. 
For all evolutionary computations performed for a problem instance, the EMF instance models (xmi files) of the approximation sets of the last iterations are available in the main folder of that problem instance.

## Analysis folder ##
The analysis folder contains data collected by an analytical tool from the output of MDEOptimiser.
The folder itself contains a summary report for all problem instances which gives an overview over the most important metrics:
- the mean number of iterations,
- different aggregations of the normalized hypervolume,
- the standard deviation for the mean normalized hypervolume,
- the overall contributions of a specific algorithmic variant to the union of all cumulative approximation sets of all variants for the respective problem instance, and
- the BSR which is the percentage of these contributions.
Additionally, for each problem instance an overview over some statistical values is provided in a separate file. They need to be read as row x column, i.e., 
a positive value for Cliff's delta means that the variant in the header of the respective row performs better than the variant in the header of the respective column.

A separate folder for each problem instance contains more in depth information about the performed evolutionary computations. The names of the files are chosen to be self-explanatory.

## Charts folder ##
Based on the data in the analysis folder, charts contains visualizations of the progress of different metrics.
